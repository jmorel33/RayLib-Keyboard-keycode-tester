# RayLib-Keyboard-keycode-tester

Note that I could not get RaySan5 to modify core.c to include the following functionality;
 SetScreenshotKey()
 
 That being said, simply comment it out.  Note that the F12 function key is reserved in RayLib for the screenshot / GIF recording routine.
 
 
Refer to following issue for infromation on how to obtain SetScreenshotKey()
